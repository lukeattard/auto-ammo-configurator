Adds a startup option to set the amount of ammo inserters load into Gun Turrets, Rocket Turrets and Railgun Turrets.  

By default only 10 magazines/rockets are loaded by inserters into turrets.  Now you can set a higher value to ensure you are locked and loaded and ready for what ever comes your way.
